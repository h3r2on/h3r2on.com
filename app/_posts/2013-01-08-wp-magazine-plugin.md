In my time at UW-Oshkosh I came across an issue where I needed to control what stories loaded on the homepage of a Wordpress magazine site. I never found a good plugin to meet my need of just whiching which version was showing so, I made one.
It is overly simple and does just what I needs to. I finally got around to putting it up on [github repo](https://github.com/h3r2on/wp-magazine-control). Suggestions/pull resquests highly welcome.
