One of the problems I've always had is that when i want to write a new blogpost I have to be on a machine that has git and my site pulled to it. Not always an easy task to accomplish on a tablet or phone or on someone else's machine.

Enter [Prose.io](http://prose.io), a super clean and easy way use github pages for post writing and accessible from any web browser.
